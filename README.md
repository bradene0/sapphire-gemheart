A python based password vault that stores passwords cryptographically. This project will highlight my skills in Python and cryptography. Eventually I would like to be able to implement this into a website where instead of writing the password to a text file, it writes to a secure database.

This could also be turned into a chrome or firefox extension

!!! Do not use any of this code if working with secure data or within a production database as this method of storing passwords in the code seen here is NOT secure !!!
